# CollabJam-Server

## Setup MongoDB

To use the server you need a MongoDB server running. You can install the server locally or use the docker compose configuration from the repository by executing:

```
docker compose up
```

This also launches a Mongo Express instance on `http://localhost:8081` to inspect the database.
